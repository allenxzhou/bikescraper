# Bike Scrapy
Status:
- [ ] Adding in a terminal user prompt
- [ ] Updating code functionality (e.g. Craigslist HTML changes)
- [ ] Adding in a search functionality (instead of hardcoded)

Backstory: In the Summer of 2013, I embarked on what I thought would be a long and arduous journey to find myself a new bicycle. I was in the market for a road bike with specific features (i.e. 52'' frame, good brand, 105 or better shifters). However, after a few days of manually clicking on over a hundred Craigslist ads, my cramped hand relegated the bike searching task to my programming brain. My brain then put my cramped hand (and other perfectly relaxed hand) back to work to produce code that would scrape Craigslist ads based on the feature set I desired. And thus, the bike scraper (recently named "Bike Scrapy") was born.

*This bike scraper is built from scratch. I thought about using Scrapy, but I figured creating a scraper from ground-up would be more enjoyable than necessarily calling an API. Maybe I'll switch over to Scrapy in the future... Maybe.*
